        <p>Raiders of the Lost Ark</p>
        <p>I have never seen these movies but Indiana Jones is very cool.</p>

        <div class="column">
          <img src="images/temple.jpg" alt="temple image" style="width:100%"/>
          <p>Temple of Doom</p>
          <p>This film was released to financial success but inital reviews were mixed
            critizing its darker elements and violence. However, critical opinion has improved
            since 1984, citing the film's intensity and imagination.</p>

            <img src="images/crusade.jpg" alt="crusade image" style="width:100%"/>
            <p>The Last crusade</p>
            <p>After the mixed reaction to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,
              Speilberg chose to tone down the dark tone and graphic violence in the next
              installment. During the five years between the Temple of the Doom and the
              Last crusade, he and executive producer Lucas, reviewed several scripts before acccepting
              Jeffrey Boam's.</p>
